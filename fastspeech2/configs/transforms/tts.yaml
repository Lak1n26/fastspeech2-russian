# Transforms configuration for FastSpeech2
# Currently not used as we work with pre-extracted features
# This file can be used if you want to add data augmentation

instance_transforms:
  train: null  # No instance transforms needed for pre-extracted features
  inference: null  # No instance transforms needed for inference

# Example of possible transforms (commented out):
# instance_transforms:
#   train:
#     - _target_: some_augmentation_module.TimeStretch
#       rate: 1.1
#     - _target_: some_augmentation_module.PitchShift
#       n_steps: 2
#   inference: null
